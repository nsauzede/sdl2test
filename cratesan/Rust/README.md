# Build prerequisites for Windows
On Linux, you only need to install standard SDL2 dev packages (search for that elsewhere on the web).

On Windows, follow [the rust-sdl2 instructions](https://github.com/Rust-SDL2/rust-sdl2).
At the end, you should have the folders "gnu-mingw" and "msvc" alongside this README.md,
in order to build on Windows.
