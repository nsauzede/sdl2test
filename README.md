# sdl2test
Small examples of SDL1 vs. SDL2 usage, in V, C and C++ languages.

Makefile auto-detects available SDL version (2 or 1)

- tetris_v.v is inspired from original source from Alex V example, ported to SDL and enhanced with sounds
- vsdl : naive V wrapper for SDL2 binding
- CSDL : small C++ class to abstract SDL1/2
